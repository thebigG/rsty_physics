Exploring Physics with Godot4 and Rust.


## Goals of this project

- Explore physics. Dive deep into it. This will be a great tool for future endeavors(specially in games).
- Explore Godot4 at the same time. There are a lot of cool and interesting things in Godot4. Such as a new Physics stack, new modules system and a lot of other improvements.
- Explore Rust in the context of Godot. The godot-rust project is young, but I like a lot of the ideas in it. Ideally this project allows me to explore writing generic godot modules in Rust for Godot Engine. Similar to https://github.com/thebigG/godot-3.x-modules but in Rust.
- Have fun and learn.

## Non-goals of this project

- Make a product. While ideally a lot of useful code comes out of this, I won't get bogged down with making everything modular/testable etc. Like stated above, I want to have fun doing this. So while I will invest effort into making things re-usable, learning/exploration take higher priority over shipping anything. The main goal here is to learn ;).
